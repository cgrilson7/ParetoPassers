## Pareto Passers

### Pareto-efficient performances through NFL history.

The repository contains scripts used to scrape from Pro-Football-Reference.com's play index finder and find the Pareto fronts for various criteria in player game logs, using Patrick Roocks's rPref package: https://www.p-roocks.de/rpref/

Inspired by Neil Paine and Andrea Jones-Rooy's article on Pareto games in basketball: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/explaining-james-hardens-monster-game-with-a-century-old-economic-theory/
